# Video Calling Feature - User Guide

The chat application now supports video calling directly within your chat rooms. This guide explains how to use this feature effectively.

## Starting a Video Call

1. Join a chat room with another user
2. Look for the green phone icon in the message input area
3. Click the green phone icon to initiate a call
4. Wait for the other user to answer

## Receiving a Video Call

When someone calls you, you'll see:

1. A notification at the bottom of your screen
2. Two buttons: green (answer) and red (decline)
3. Click the green phone button to accept the call
4. Click the red phone button to reject the call

## During a Call

While in a call, you have several controls:

1. **Mute/Unmute**: Toggle your microphone on/off
2. **End Call**: Hang up and terminate the connection
3. **Video On/Off**: Toggle your camera on/off

Your video appears in the small window in the bottom right, while the other person's video fills the main screen.

## Permissions

When starting or answering a call for the first time:
- Your browser will request access to your camera and microphone
- You must allow these permissions for the call to work
- If you accidentally deny permissions, you'll need to reset them in your browser settings

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **No sound/video**: Check browser permissions and ensure your camera/mic are working
2. **Call fails to connect**: Both users must have good internet connections
3. **Poor quality**: Consider using a wired internet connection for better stability
4. **Browser compatibility**: Video calling works best in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
